## 🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe AI – React Project

An **unbeatable** Tic-Tac-Toe game built using **React** with AI logic that uses a decision-making strategy similar to the **minimax algorithm** (custom implementation without recursion). The AI can block, fork, and always try to win — making it extremely challenging for human players.
